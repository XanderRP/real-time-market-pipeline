Step-by-Step Plan
Step 1: Project Setup
Tech Stack: Kafka, Python, Spark, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Airflow, Metabase

Create a GitHub repo: real-time-market-pipeline

Set up local Docker containers for Kafka, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Metabase using docker-compose

Step 2: Simulate Real-Time Market Data
Write a Python script that fetches or simulates stock price data every second (e.g., using yfinance or synthetic random walk).

Send records to a Kafka topic market_data_raw in real-time (confluent-kafka or kafka-python)

Step 3: Build Kafka Consumer & Spark Job
Set up a Kafka consumer in Spark Structured Streaming (in Python or Scala)

Parse and transform the data (e.g., JSON to structured format, calculate moving averages or volatility)

Output to:

PostgreSQL for transactional data

BigQuery for analytical/archival data

Step 4: Schedule ETL with Airflow
Use Airflow (via Docker) to:

Orchestrate Spark jobs

Move data daily/hourly from PostgreSQL to BigQuery (or vice versa)

Backfill past simulated days

Define DAGs with retries, email alerts, and metadata logging

Step 5: Create Metabase Dashboards
Connect Metabase to PostgreSQL and BigQuery

Build 5 dashboards:

Ticker Summary

Price Volatility Heatmap

Volume Trends

Top Gainers/Losers

Custom Report Export (automated weekly)

Step 6: Documentation
Write a README: architecture diagram, tooling, instructions

Use dbt for model transformations (optional polish)

Record a short Loom or blog post demo
